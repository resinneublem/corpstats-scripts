<p>I'm looking for a small gang PVP corporation and after finding a potential corp, there are three things I usually do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check their Monthly History on zkillboard to get a sense of their recent activity. Example: <a href="https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1018389948/stats/">https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1018389948/stats/</a> <em>(I hear dreddit is recruiting)</em>.</li>
<li>Ask about their timezone activity. (I'm looking for US Eastern between 0:00-3:00 EVE).</li>
<li>Ask about their typical fleets. (I'm looking for a mix of micro gang, 2-4, and small gang, up to 10),</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I have found that with the last two questions, people have a way of exaggerating. Or it might be they really don't know so they're just guessing.</p>

<p>With zkillboard's public API, the last two questions are fairly easy to guestimate based on their killboard activity. Now obviously this isn't the only criteria for choosing a corp, but this does help to quickly get a feel for their PVP activity.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm not above begging. So if you find any of this useful, feel free to send donations to "Resin Neublem" in game. If some wealthy benefactor finds this extremely useful, I may make this into a small webapp.</p>

<p>This is just a few scripts slapped together and shared. None of this is robust and they all likely contain bugs.</p>

<p>Do not hammer the zkillboard API. Don't re-download the data unless you have to.</p>

<p>First make sure both Ruby 2.x and R are installed. Then make sure you bundle the dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>1) Find the corporation ID by looking at the URL on zkillboard or eve-kill.net. For example, the dreddit ID above is 1018389948.</p>

<p>2) Run <code>./last_1000_kills.sh &lt;corporation_id&gt;</code>. That will download the last 1000 kills from the zkillboard API and then turn it into a csv.</p>

<p>3) Start R by running <code>R</code> and inside the prompt run these commands:</p>

<pre><code>source("killboard.R")         # this only needs to run the first time to load the R functions
report(1018389948, "dreddit") # just finds the csv for that corporation and generates a couple reports
</code></pre>

<p>That will create a pdf in the folder "reports".</p>

<p>Some examples of PVP corporations that are recruiting in the <a href="https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=topics&amp;f=265">EVE Forums</a> are available in the <a href="https://github.com/resinneublem/corpstats-scripts/tree/master/examples">examples folder</a>.</p>
